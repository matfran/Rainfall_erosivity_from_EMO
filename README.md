# Rainfall_erosivity_from_EMO

A repository containing the code to simulate time series of rainfall erosivity events from timeseries of EMO. The script processes multitemporal pixel extractions into a time series of rainfall erosivity events (EI30). The relationship between rainfall depth and rainfall erosivity is determined on per climate region based on monthly empirical relationships between the two.

For a further explanation, see the paper:

The code runs directly when scripts are placed in the file with the input data.
